# TODO

Flat list. Each entry tagged with `#release` and `#area`. Done items are deleted, not struck through.

## Foundational

- Wire protobuf codegen into the prebuild step (ts-proto + protoc, or buf) once a consumer of generated types lands #r0 #toolchain
- Flesh out R0 `Query` result message bodies as the dashboard UI takes shape #r0 #protocol
- `Clock` port for sim core (when achieved-speed telemetry needs it) #r0 #sim
- Cross-process NodeTransport variant: NDJSON over stdio, symmetric with the eventual Rust binary #r0 #transport
- Per-run OPFS slots (currently all runs reuse `runId='default'`; switching slots needs a UI for slot management) #r0 #host
- Snapshot reaper for orphaned snap files left behind when a newRun resets the slot #r0 #host
- Rebuild-from-log fallback when a snapshot is missing or unreadable (ARCHITECTURE.md migration path); currently load fails fast in that case #r0 #host
- Tune snapshot cadence once R0 has real behaviour to scrub through; 30,000 ticks is a heuristic per ARCHITECTURE.md #r0 #host

## Release 1 — Scarcity

- Mutation: priority swap (needs ≥2 directive kinds in firmware to be meaningful) #r1 #sim
- Mutation: directive loss / gain (needs ≥2 directive kinds in firmware to be meaningful) #r1 #sim
- Forensic replay: state-rewind scrub UI (load nearest snapshot + advance to selected tick); the events-timeline shape is in place, the data path supports it, the affordance waits on R1+ producing more events worth rewinding to #r1 #ui
